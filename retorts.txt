[gap]
Senna was talking about the age gap not the car gap.
Who said you were a racing driver?
And how well did that work out for Senna?
The only Gap you should be going for is in a shopping mall.
Is that why you have so many STDS?
If you hang this quote on your sleeve, the whole grid probably hates you.
Emphasis on “that exists”.
Translated: “I’m an asshat that has no regard anyone else on the track”
Oh shut up and ruin my race already!
You know what else is a gap? The circuit exit.
I can see how someone like you would think that's a good quote to use.
I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.
If I wanted to find out what an asshole would have said, I would have farted. 
The way you pull into gaps makes me wish your father would have pulled out of one.

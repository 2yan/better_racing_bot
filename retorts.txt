[gap]
Senna was talking about the age gap not the car gap.
Who said you were a racing driver?
Senna was telling a lie at the time and used that line to cover up for the fact that he deliberately took out Prost. He later admitted this because "his God was judging him".
And how well did that work out for Senna?
The only Gap you should be going for is in a shopping mall.
Is that why you have so many STDS?
This quote is used as justification for bad overtakes.
If you hang this quote on your sleeve, the whole grid probably hates you.
Emphasis on “that exists”.
Translated: “I’m an asshat that has no regard anyone else on the track”
Oh shut up an ruin my race already!
You know what else is a gap? The circuit exit.

[rubbing]
If you believe in the rubbin & racing thing then maybe, stop rubbing your balls and keep both hands on the wheel.
People that think rubbing is racing, just don't know how to keep bumpers out of other bumpers. 
If you believe rubbing is racing, then just keep rubbing em out and try not to breed.
Rubbing ain't racing. A good driver passes you without you knowing they're even there. 
Racing is racing, yeeting someone off the racing line means you just don't know how to position a pass properly.
I'm not sure "rubbing is racing" counts in any form of open-wheel racing. In that case rubbing most likely results in broken suspensions, punctures or spectacular barrel rolls!!
Cringe racing driver equivalent of “If you can’t handle me at my worst you don’t deserve me at my best” 
"Stfu that's cringe and ruins races"

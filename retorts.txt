[gap]
Senna was talking about the age gap not the car gap.
Who said you were a racing driver?
And how well did that work out for Senna?
The only Gap you should be going for is in a shopping mall.
Is that why you have so many STDS?
If you hang this quote on your sleeve, the whole grid probably hates you.
Emphasis on “that exists”.
Translated: “I’m an asshat that has no regard anyone else on the track”
Oh shut up and ruin my race already!
You know what else is a gap? The circuit exit.
I can see how someone like you would think that's a good quote to use.
I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.
If I wanted to find out what an asshole would have said, I would have farted. 
The way you pull into gaps makes me wish your father would have pulled out of one.  


[rubbing]
If you believe in the rubbin & racing thing then maybe, stop rubbing your balls and keep both hands on the wheel.
If you believe rubbing is racing, then just keep rubbing em out and try not to breed.
Would you still believe that rubbing is racing if your parents were second cousins instead of first?
I'm not sure "rubbing is racing" counts in any form of open-wheel racing. In that case rubbing most likely results in broken suspensions, punctures or spectacular barrel rolls!!
Cringe racing driver equivalent of “If you can’t handle me at my worst you don’t deserve me at my best” 
I hope you've realized that all other people in grid just put up with you. 

[nascar+rubbing]
I was gonna be all grumpy about "Rubbing is Racing" but it looks like you mentioned NASCAR as well and as far as I know, this is actually true for NASCAR.
